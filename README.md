# A-Frame VR Gallery

This is an A-Frame demo from Adam Hughes. It is used on my talks and a tutorial can be found on [Web Designer Depot](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2017/11/creating-webvr-experiences-with-a-frame/)

## Note:
To run this project locally you need to have some sort of local server running.

I recommend [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or following the [A-Frame guide](https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/introduction/installation.html#use-a-local-server)
